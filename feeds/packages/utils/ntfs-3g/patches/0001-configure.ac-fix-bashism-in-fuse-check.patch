Subject: [PATCH 1/5] configure.ac: fix bashism in fuse check

configure scripts need to be runnable with a POSIX-compliant /bin/sh.

On many (but not all!) systems, /bin/sh is provided by Bash, so errors
like this aren't spotted. Notably Debian defaults to /bin/sh provided
by dash which doesn't tolerate such bashisms as '=='.

This retains compatibility with bash.

Fixes configure warnings/errors like:
```
checking Windows OS... no
./configure: 13360: test: xinternal: unexpected operator
checking for pthread_create in -lpthread... yes
checking Solaris OS... no
```
