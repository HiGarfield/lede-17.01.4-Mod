Source: libgcrypt-1.6.6.tar.bz2
Type: ipkg
Description:  This is a general purpose cryptographic library based on the code from
 GnuPG. It provides functions for all cryptograhic building blocks:
 symmetric ciphers (AES, DES, Arcfour, CAST5), hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-1,
 RIPE-MD160, SHA-224/256, SHA-384/512), MACs (HMAC for all hash
 algorithms), public key algorithms (RSA, DSA), large integer functions,
 random numbers and a lot of supporting functions. Some algorithms have
 been disabled to reduce size (Blowfish, Twofish, Serpent,
 RC2, SEED, Camellia, CRC, MD4, TIGER-192, Whirlpool, ElGamal, ECC).
