Description:         Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an interactive
        login  shell  and  as a shell script command processor. Of the standard
        shells, zsh most closely resembles ksh but includes many enhancements.
        Zsh has command line editing, builtin spelling correction, programmable
        command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history
        mechanism, and a host of other features.
