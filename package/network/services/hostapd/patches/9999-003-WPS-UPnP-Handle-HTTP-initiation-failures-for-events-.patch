Subject: [PATCH 3/5] WPS UPnP: Handle HTTP initiation failures for events more
 properly

While it is appropriate to try to retransmit the event to another
callback URL on a failure to initiate the HTTP client connection, there
is no point in trying the exact same operation multiple times in a row.
Replve the event_retry() calls with event_addr_failure() for these cases
to avoid busy loops trying to repeat the same failing operation.

These potential busy loops would go through eloop callbacks, so the
process is not completely stuck on handling them, but unnecessary CPU
would be used to process the continues retries that will keep failing
for the same reason.
