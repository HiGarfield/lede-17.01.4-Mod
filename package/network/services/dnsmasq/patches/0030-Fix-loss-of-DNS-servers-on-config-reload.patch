Subject: [PATCH 30/39] Fix loss of DNS servers on config reload.

A bug, introduced in 2.87, which could result in DNS
servers being removed from the configuration when reloading
server configuration from DBus, or re-reading /etc/resolv.conf
Only servers from the same source should be replaced, but some
servers from other sources (ie hard coded or another dynamic source)
could mysteriously disappear.
