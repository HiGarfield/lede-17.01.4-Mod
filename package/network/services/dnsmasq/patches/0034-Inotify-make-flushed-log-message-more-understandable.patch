Subject: [PATCH 34/39] Inotify: make "flushed" log message more
 understandable.

Saying we've "flushed x outdated entries" is confusing, since
the count is the total number of entries in the modified file,
most of which are going	to get added straight back when	the file
is re-read.

The log now looks like

dnsmasq: inotify: /tmp/dir/1 (new or modified)
dnsmasq: inotify: flushed 1 addresses read from /tmp/dir/1
dnsmasq: read /tmp/dir/1 - 2 addresses

which hopefully make it more obvious that /tmp/dir/1 contained one
address before, and now contains two.
